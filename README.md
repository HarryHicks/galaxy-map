# galaxy-map

Interactive map of the Star Wars galaxy, built with TypeScript and React.js. The map uses:
- [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) to plot GeoJSON of planets, sectors, regions, and other points of interest in the Star Wars galaxy
- [react-leaflet-markercluster](https://github.com/YUzhva/react-leaflet-markercluster) for 'clustering' planet markers based on zoom level
- [react-leaflet-search](https://github.com/tumerorkun/react-leaflet-search) to allow searching for planets by name
